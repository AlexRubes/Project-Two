# Project-Two

## Rough sketch of events
- Page loads with a map and a search box for your location
- User enters in a search and the map loads with pinpoints for facilities that work with toxic chemicals
- Users can hover over or click on the facilities to get more information as a pop-up window
    - Information will possibly include:
        - Name of faciliy
        - What chemicals they work with
        - What health effects have been known about those chemicals
        - Links to click to learn more

## Possibile Features
- An "action" step where they could find their local representative and contact them?
- Other pages that could contain information on environmental news
